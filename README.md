## How to use:

Most importantly, the style (CSS) on page having scalable text is applicable to entire book whenever text takes over. Note the very little amount of CSS that is required!  

## Additional reference:
If you're into Codepen for front-end experiments then you might want to check out some of these [pieces](http://codepen.io/marvindanig/public/) too.

    <h1> The Great Red Spot </h1>
    <p> A notable feature on the surface of Jupiter is The Great Red Spot. It is an enormous storm, an atmospheric vortex like a hurricane, that is known to have persisted for over 400 years; ever since observation through telescopes began. The Red Spot is
      so large that it can fit three Earths within itself. In 1996 the space probe Galileo took the following closeup of it showing turbulences in its vicinity: </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/The-Solar-System/master/images/page-53/Red-Spot.jpg"

    <p> Notice the other smaller vortex in the bottom left corner?: It's the <a hreff="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/02mar_redjr/">Oval BA</a> or popularly known as The Red Spot Jr. </p>
    <p> The Great Red Spot has been shrinking in size over the past few years, while the Oval BA has been growing. It is not clear why. The Juno spacecraft that is set to arrive on Jupiter in 2016 will investigate the Red Spots and help us understand what
      is happening to them. </p>

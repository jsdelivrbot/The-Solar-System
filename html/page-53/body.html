    <h1> The Great Red Spot </h1>
    <p> One of the notable features on the surface of Jupiter is The Great Red Spot. It is an enormous atmospheric vortex, like a hurricane, that is known to have persisted for over 400 years; ever since telescopic observation began. The Red Spot is so large
      that it can fit three Earths within itself. Space probe Galileo took the following closeup of the Spot showing turbulences in its vicinity: </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/The-Solar-System/master/images/page-53/Red-Spot.jpg"

    <p> Note the other smaller vortex in the bottom left corner!: It's known as The Oval BA or The Red Spot Jr. </p>
    <p> Measurements show that the Great Red Spot has been shrinking in size over the past few years. The NASA's spacecraft Juno will examine the Red Spots directly in 2016 to help us understand why it is shrinking off late. </p>

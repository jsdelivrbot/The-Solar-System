    <h1> The Great Red Spot </h1>
    <p> One of the notable features of Jupiter is The Great Red Spot. It is an enormous atmospheric vortex, like a hurricane, that is known to have persisted for over 400 years; ever since telescopic observation began. The Red Spot is so large that it can
      fit three Earths within itself! Following is a closeup by our space probe Galileo showing turbulences in its vicinity. </p>

    <p> Note the other smaller vortex in the bottom left corner: The Oval BA or The Red Spot Jr. </p>
    <p> Latest measurements show that the Great Red Spot is shrinking in size. NASA's Juno spacecraft is currently on course toward Jupiter, and likely to reach the giant planet by July 2016. Direct examination of the Spot by Juno will help unravel why it
      is shrinking. </p>

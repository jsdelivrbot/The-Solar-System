    <p> The Martian surface is very feature-rich and remarkable. It has the largest known volcano of our Solar System â€“ <a href="">The Olympus Mons </a> - that is about 375 miles wide and ~69,000 feet high. It has a grander canyon - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valles_Marineris">The Valles Marineris</a>      - that is ~2,500 miles long and up to 4 miles deep. In comparison the Grand Canyon of Arizona is only ~500 miles in length and only a mile deep. </p>
    <p> Mars has polar ice caps of water and dry ice. It is thought that Mars once had very large rivers of water but most of it was lost to space due to low gravity and lack of a protective atmosphere. Measurements indicate that Mars continues to leave a
      trail of atmospheric elements behind itself on its orbit; meaning it is still losing its atmosphere. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/The-Solar-System/master/images/page-45/polar-ice.jpg" width="100%" /> </div>

    <h1> Europa </h1>
    <p> Among all the planets and moons of our Solar System, Europa is perhaps the most interesting celestial body to look at. It is very similar to Earth in composition and is thought to be covered in ocean of liquid water. Some estimates suggest that Europa
      has almost three times as much water in volume as Earth does. There is oxygen in its rather tenuous atmosphere and its soil exhibits seasalt formation and discharge of clay-like silicious material. </p>
    <p>Signs often associated with microbial organic activity.</p>
    <p> Europa is only slightly smaller than our Moon, at 1,900 mi in diameter. It is primarily made up of silicate rocks and probably an ironâ€“nickel core, and is covered in water followed by a thick icy crust of about 62 miles. </p>

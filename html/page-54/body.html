    <h1> Europa </h1>
    <p> Among all the planets and moons of our Solar System Europa is perhaps the most interesting celestial body to look at. It is very similar to Earth in composition and is only slightly smaller than our Moon. Europa has a diameter of 1,900 miles. Its
      thin crust is 62 miles deep and made up of mostly water-ice and silicious rocks.Under the icy crust it is thought that Europa has an ocean of liquid water. Roughly three times as much water in volume as there is on Earth. One can imagine Europa
      like a spherical drop of water floating in space where the outer surface has been frozen. </p>
    <p> Europa has a rather tenuous atmosphere made up of molecular Oxygen. Unlike on Earth, where Oxygen is produced via plant photosynthesis, on Europa it is formed due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolysis">molecular dissociation</a> caused
      by radiation from Jupiter. Observations have also detected discharge of seasalts and clay-like silicious material on its surface. Signs that are often associated to organic microbial activity. </p>
    <p> Some estimates indicate that a portion of atmospheric Oxygen makes its way in to the ocean making conditions there comparable to our deep seas on Earth. Given Europa's potential for life, two major missions have been planned to visit Europa in the
      coming years: The NASA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper">Europa Cipper </a> and ESA's <a href="http://sci.esa.int/juice/50068-science-objectives/">JUICE</a>.

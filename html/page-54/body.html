    <h1> Europa </h1>
    <p> Among all the planets and moons of our Solar System, Europa is perhaps the most interesting celestial body to look at. It is very similar to Earth in composition and is thought to be covered in ocean of liquid water. Some estimates suggest that Europa
      has almost three times as much water in volume as Earth does. There is oxygen in its rather tenuous atmosphere and its soil exhibits seasalt formation and discharges of clay-like silicious material, often associated with organic life.</p>
    <p> Europa is thought to be life-bearing already,. </p>
    <p>Although it is yet to be established but signs of extra-terrestial life on Europa are interesting enough for both NASA and ESA to fire up rockets and visit Europa in the next one decade. </p>

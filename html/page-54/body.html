    <h1> Europa </h1>
    <p> Among all the celestial bodies of our Solar System, Europa is perhaps the most interesting object to look at. It is very similar to Earth in composition and is only slightly smaller than our Moon (1,900 miles in diameter). Its thin crust is 62 miles
      deep and made up of mostly water-ice and silicious rocks. Under its icy crust, it is thought, that Europa has an ocean of liquid water. Roughly three times as much water in volume as there is on Earth. One can imagine Europa like a spherical drop
      of water floating in sky where the outer surface is frozen. </p>
    <p> Europa has a rather tenuous atmosphere made up of molecular Oxygen. Unlike on Earth, where Oxygen is produced via plant photosynthesis, on Europa it is formed due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolysis">molecular dissociation</a> caused
      by radiation from Jupiter. Observations have also detected discharge of seasalts and clay-like silicious material on its surface. These are signs often associated with organic microbial activity. </p>

    <p> Measurements suggest that a portion of atmospheric Oxygen makes its way in to the ocean of Europa, making conditions there comparable to the deep seas on Earth. Given Europa's potential for life, two major missions have been planned to visit the moon
      in the coming years: The NASA's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-europa-mission-begins-with-selection-of-science-instruments">Europa Clipper </a> and ESA's <a href="http://sci.esa.int/juice/50068-science-objectives/">JUICE</a>.

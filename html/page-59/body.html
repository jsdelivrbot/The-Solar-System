    <p> <span class="first-word">S</span>aturn is the sixth planet of our Solar System. It's also the second largest planet, a gas-giant that is very similar to Jupiter. Saturn is 890 million miles from the Sun. Its orbital period is 29.5 years and rotational
      period just under 10 hours 34 minutes. Given the high speed of rotation and gaseous-fluid state like that of Jupiter, Saturn is also an oblate-spheroid. It is in fact the flattest of all the planets. </p>
    <p> What's remarkable about Saturn however, is its large, colorful and concentric planetary ring system. Other gas and ice giants possess planetary rings too, but none can match the size or beauty of the ones on Saturn. Exotic rings are also a reason
      why Saturn is called the Jewel of The Heavens. Saturn has a total of 62 moons of which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28moon%29">Titan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_%28moon%29">Rhea</a> are the most notable. Titan,
      like the Ganymede of Jupiter, is larger than planet Mercury. </p>
    <p> Saturn is very similar to Jupiter in composition. Its atmosphere is 96% Hydrogen and 3.25% Helium followed by traces of Ammonia, Phosphene and a few lower hydrocarbons. The interior of Saturn, unlike that of Jupiter, most likely has a solid core at
      its center. A rocky core enveloped in a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen followed by molecular hydrogen transitioning gradually from liquid state to a gaseous atmosphere. Our space probe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini</a>      is currently in orbit around Saturn to do more research on the planet. </p>

    <p> <span class="first-word">S</span>aturn is the sixth planet of our Solar System. It's also the second largest planet, a gas-giant that is very similar to Jupiter. Saturn is 890 million miles from the Sun. It has an orbital period of 29.5 years and
      a rotational period of just under 10 hours 34 minutes. Given the high speed of its rotation and gaseous-fluid make up Saturn is oblate-spheroid in shape. It is in fact the flattest of all the planets in the Solar System. </p>
    <p> What's remarkable about Saturn are its large, concentric and colorful rings. Other gas and ice giants also possess planetary rings, but none can match the size or beauty of the ones on Saturn. Exotic rings are also the reason why Saturn is called
      the Jewel of The Heavens. Saturn has a total of 62 moons of which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28moon%29">Titan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_%28moon%29">Rhea</a> are the most notable. Titan, like the Ganymede
      of Jupiter, is larger than planet Mercury. </p>
    <p> Saturn is similar to Jupiter in composition. Its atmosphere is 96% Hydrogen and 3.25% Helium followed by traces of Ammonia, Phosphene and a few other lower hydrocarbons. The interior of Saturn, unlike that of Jupiter, is known to have a solid core
      at its center. A rocky core enveloped in a layer of metallic hydrogen followed by molecular hydrogen transitioning gradually from liquid to gaseous state of atmosphere. NASA's space probe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini</a>      is currently in orbit around Saturn for further research on the planet. </p>

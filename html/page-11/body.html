    <p> The heliocentric model triggered a revolution, the <em>Copernican Revolution, </em> that led to more work and many more discoveries in the field of astronomy over the next one century. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler"> Johannes Kepler </a>      (1571 - 1630), a German scientist, concluded that planets moved in elliptical orbits and not in circular or epicyclic ones. Kepler's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"> Three Laws of Planetary Motion</a> endorsed
      the physical reality of the Copernican model and corroborated it with real astronomical data.</p>

    <p> It sports a 12.5 mile high scarp <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_Rupes">Verona Rupes</a> that is probably the tallest cliff in the Solar System. Uranus also has planetary rings but, unlike those of Jupiter or Saturn, its rings are much
      lighter and run perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Uranus goes around the Sun every 84 years. Due to its extreme axial tilt (~98°) only one of the poles gets sun light for a full 42 years. The other pole stays in complete darkness until an equinox.
      There are two places on its orbit where the Uranus has the Sun directly above its equator — the point of Equinoxes. The last equinox happened on December 7<sup>th</sup>, 2007 following which now Uranus has its north pole pointing towards the Sun.

      Uranus has a thick atmosphere mainly comprising of molecular Hydrogen, Helium and Methane. Lower hydrocarbons like Methane give it an aquamarine or greenish hue. That's why it's called the green planet. The internal structure of Uranus consists of three
      layers: a solid rocky core, an icy mantle and an outer envelope of liquid hydrogen and helium that extends right up to its atmosphere without any defined boundary/surface. Simulations indicate that the ice-mantle of Uranus is largely an ocean of
      water and ammonia (brine) over a base of liquid diamonds that has floating icebergs of diamond in it. But the high pressure chemistry and physical state of Uranus is not fully understood yet. </p>

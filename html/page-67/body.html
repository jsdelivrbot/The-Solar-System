    <p> Miranda sports a 12.5 mile high scarp <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_Rupes">Verona Rupes</a> that is probably the tallest cliff in the Solar System. Uranus also has light planetary rings that run perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.
      Uranus goes around the Sun every 84 years, and due to its extreme axial tilt (~98°) only one of the poles gets sun light for a full 42 years. The other pole remains in complete darkness until an equinox. There are two places on its orbit where Uranus
      has the Sun directly above its equator — the point of Equinoxes. The last equinox happened on December 7<sup>th</sup>, 2007 following which Uranus has its north pole pointing towards the Sun. </p>
    <p> Uranus has a thick atmosphere mainly comprising of molecular Hydrogen, Helium and Methane. Lower hydrocarbons like Methane give it an aquamarine or greenish hue. That's why it's called the green planet. The internal structure of Uranus consists of
      three layers: a solid rocky core, an icy mantle and an outer envelope of liquid hydrogen and helium that extends right up to its atmosphere without any defined boundary/surface. </p>
    <p> A very interesting fact about Uranus is that it may have an ice-mantle of liquid diamond that even has icebergs of diamond floating in it. The high pressure chemistry and physical state of Uranus is still under study. </p>

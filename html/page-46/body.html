    <h1> Which to terraform first: Moon or Mars? </h1>
    <p> An interesting question about off-planet settlements is to ask which host is preferable for early colonization? Given that our bodies are fragile and our resources limited is it better to try the Moon first or try Mars instead? We know that both of
      them are in the <i>habitable zone</i> of our Solar System and both have a few things that suit the needs of humans beings. </p>
    <p> For example, we Moon we have: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Same orbit as that of Earth </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">A manageable distance </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Presence of water </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Experience of being there before</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p> While with Mars there is: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Stronger gravity</a> </li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Nutrient rich soil </a></li>
      <li><a class="disable" href="javascript;">An atmosphere at a reasonable pressure</a> </li>
      <li><a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Presence of water, probably some in liquid form</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p> On the Moon there is no oxygen to breathe though. </p>

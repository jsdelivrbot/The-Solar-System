    <h1> Which one to terraform first: Moon or Mars? </h1>
    <p> An interesting question about off-planet settlements is to ask which host is better for colonization. Given that human body is fragile and our resources are limited, is it better to terraform the Moon first or try Mars instead? We know that both are
      in the <i>habitable zone</i> of our Solar System and have a few things that suit the needs of humans beings. </p>
    <p> For example, Moon has the following advantages: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Same orbit as that of Earth </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">A manageable distance from Earth </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Presence of water </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Experience of being there before</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p> While Mars has the following: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Stronger gravity</a> </li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Nutrient rich soil </a></li>
      <li><a class="disable" href="javascript;">An atmosphere at a reasonable pressure</a> </li>
      <li><a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Presence of water, probably some in liquid form</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p> On the Moon, however, there is no Oxygen to breathe. </p>

    <h1> Which to terraform first: Moon or Mars? </h1>
    <p> An interesting question about early off-planet settlements is to measure which host is better suited for humans, given our limited resources. Is it the Moon or the Mars? We know that both Moon and Mars are in the <i>habitable zone</i> of our Solar
      System and that both have a few things that suit the needs of sustainable Earth-like life. </p>
    <p> For example, with Moon we have the following advantages: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href=""> Same orbit as that of Earth, therefore similar sunlight. </a></li>
      <li> <a href="">A manageable distance from home</a></li>
      <li> <a href="">Presence of water </a></li>
      <li> <a href="">Experience of being there before</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p> While with Mars we have the following: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a href=""> Stronger gravity</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="">Nutrient rich soil </a></li>
      <li><a href="">An atmosphere at a reasonable pressure</a> </li>
      <li><a href=""> Presence of water, probably some in liquid form</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p> But there isn't any oxygen to breathe or air to resist on Moon. </p>

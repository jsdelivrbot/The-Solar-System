    <h1> Which to terraform first: Moon or Mars? </h1>
    <p> An interesting question about early off-planet settlements is to evaluate which host is more suitable for humans to colonize, given our fragile make up and limited resources. Is Moon better or Mars? We know that both are in the <i>habitable zone</i>      of our Solar System and that each has a few ingredients that nicely fit the needs of Earth-life. </p>
    <p> For example, Moon has the following advantages: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Same orbit as that of Earth </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">A manageable distance </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Presence of water </a></li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Experience of being there before</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p> While Mars has the following: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Stronger gravity</a> </li>
      <li> <a class="disable" href="javascript;">Nutrient rich soil </a></li>
      <li><a class="disable" href="javascript;">An atmosphere at a reasonable pressure</a> </li>
      <li><a class="disable" href="javascript;"> Presence of water, probably some in liquid form</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p> On the Moon however, there isn't any oxygen to breathe. </p>

    <h1> Which to terraform first: Moon or Mars? </h1>
    <p> An interesting question pertaining to early off-planet settlements is to figure out which host is most suited for terraforming. Is it the Moon or the Mars? Now we know that both Moon and Mars are in the <i>habitable zone</i> of our Solar System and
      that both have few advantages that fit the needs of life as we know it on Earth. </p>
    <p> For example, with Moon we have the following advantages: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a class="disable" href=""> Same orbit as that of Earth </a></li>
      <li> <a href="">A manageable distance </a></li>
      <li> <a href="">Presence of water </a></li>
      <li> <a href="">Experience of being there before</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p> While with Mars we have the following: </p>
    <ol class="rectangle-list">
      <li> <a href=""> Stronger gravity</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="">Nutrient rich soil </a></li>
      <li><a href="">An atmosphere at a reasonable pressure</a> </li>
      <li><a href=""> Presence of water, probably some in liquid form</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Therefore, answering which celestial body is better suited isn't as straightforward as it seems. </p>

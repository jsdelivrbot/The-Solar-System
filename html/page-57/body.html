    <p> The atmospheric pressure in space is zero. This causes a sudden decompression of the human body upon exposure. In fact absence of atmospheric pressure is probably one of the greatest safety concerns in space. Vacuum can lead to expansion of air in
      the lungs leading to a rupture and sudden death; unless the subject exhales immediately. Decompression also lead to a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism">ebullism</a>, where the reduced pressure of environment lowers
      the boiling point of fluids in the body. It causes the water in the bloodstream and tissues to begin boiling up and vaporize. </p>
    <p> In 1965 a technician inside a vacuum chamber at Johnson Space Center in Houston accidentally depressurized his spacesuit by disrupting a hose. The man reported that his last memory before blacking out was that of the moisture on his tongue beginning
      to boil. Studies of animals in vacuum and sparse data of accidents with people have shown that depressurization can cause swelling of tissues due to accumulation of vapor under the skin; at worst, it can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism">embolism</a>,
      a blockage of blood vessels due to gas bubbles in the bloodstream and eventually death. </p>
    <p> Apart from the dangers of space discussed above, one that most certainly ends life in space is the lack of oxygen to breathe. Oxygen diffuses out of the bloodstream when exposed to vacuum leading to unconsciousness in about 15 seconds, followed by
      death in under two-three minutes. </p>

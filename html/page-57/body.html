    <p> The atmospheric pressure in space is zero. This leads to sudden decompression of the body upon exposure. In fact absence of atmospheric pressure is probably one of the gravest safety concerns in space. Vacuum can lead to rapid expansion of air in
      the lungs leading to a lung rupture and probably death; unless the subject exhales quickly enough. Decompression can also lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism">ebullism</a> where due to low surrounding pressure the fluids in the
      body begin to boil and vaporize. </p>
    <p> In 1965 a technician inside a vacuum chamber at Johnson Space Center, Houston accidentally depressurized his spacesuit by disrupting a hose. The man reported that his last memory before blacking out was that of the moisture on his tongue beginning
      to boil. Studies on animals in vacuum and the sparse data of accidents with people in low pressures suggests that vacuum is fatal if exposed for more than a few minutes. Depressurization can cause swelling of tissues due to accumulation of vapor
      under the skin unless the subject returns to a repressurized environment quickly. </p>
    <p> Apart from the dangers discussed above, the single most probable reason for death on exposure to space without a suit would be the lack of oxygen to breathe. Oxygen diffuses out of the bloodstream when exposed to vacuum leading to unconsciousness
      in under 20 seconds. What follows then is certain death because the subject is incapacitated already. </p>

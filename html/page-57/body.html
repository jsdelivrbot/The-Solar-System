    <p> Secondly, the atmospheric pressure in space is zero which leads to sudden decompression of the body upon exposure. Vacuum can lead to rapid expansion of the air in the lungs leading to a lung rupture and probable death; unless the subject exhales
      quickly enough. Decompression can also lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism">ebullism</a>, where low surrounding pressure causes the fluids in the body to boil and vaporize. </p>
    <p> In 1965 a technician inside a vacuum chamber at Johnson Space Center, Houston accidentally depressurized his spacesuit by disrupting a hose. The man reported that his last memory before blacking out was that of the moisture on his tongue beginning
      to boil. Such depressurization can cause swelling of tissues due to accumulation of vapor under the skin unless the subject returns to a repressurized environment quickly. Studies on animals and sparse data of accidents suggests that vacuum is fatal
      if exposure is even for a few minutes. </p>
    <p> Apart from the dangers discussed above, the single most probable reason for death in space is the lack of oxygen to breathe. Oxygen diffuses out of the bloodstream when exposed to vacuum leading to unconsciousness in under 20 seconds. What follows
      then is certain death because the subject is incapacitated immediately. </p>

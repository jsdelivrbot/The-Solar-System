    <p> The surface of the Sun is called Photosphere, followed by Chromosphere and then Corona. Towards the center of Sun there is a Convective Zone, a Tachocline, a Radiative Zone and then the Core â€” seat of Nuclear Fusion. Temperatures on the Sun vary greatly
      ranging from about 3800-5800K in the Photosphere to roughly 15.7 million K at the core. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/Images/master/sun-layers.jpg" / width="100%">
    <p> In addition to heat and light, the Sun also emits a stream of charged particles (electrons and protons) known as the Solar Wind. These high energy particles cause spectacular effects called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">Aurora</a> on Earth, especially at the magnetic poles. </p>

    <p> Today we know that there are eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, the Sun, the Moon and a hundred and seventy two other planetary satellites (or moons) collectively orbiting the sun. We know that there are thousands of comets, asteriods, minor
      planets and other smaller objects that circle around the Sun in a state of <i> dynamic equilibrium. </i> </p>
    <p> Our understanding of space has gotten better and the tools that help us watch and observe deep space have improved considerably. We have a floating man-made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</a>      (ISS) above the Earth to do experiments in space. There is giant <a href=""> Hubble telescope</a> to watch the sky just like Galileo did back in the day. </p>

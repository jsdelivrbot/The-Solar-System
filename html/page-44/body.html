    <p>An interesting thing about Mars is that it has two Moons - Phobos and Deimos. Imagine how much fun it'd be to watch two Moons each night. But the Martian moons are small, roughly shaped rocks orbiting very close to the planet. They're are only 14
      and 8 miles in diameter each, and are only 3,700 and 12,400 miles away from the surface of Mars. Compared to that our Moon is 2,160 miles in diatmeter and is almost 287,000 miles away from Earth. </p>
    <p> Mars has a very elongated orbit, i.e. eccentric elliptical orbit. This causes a wide variation in its climate as the planet moves away from or closer to the Sun. Mars rotates about its axis in roughly 24 hours, 37 minutes, a day that is nearly equal
      to that of Earth. But it takes twice as much time to go around the Sun than Earth. Mars is also inclined at 25.19° to its orbital plane so it too, like Earth, has seasons. </p>
    <p> In fact of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like. Only the length of a Martian season is twice that on Earth. Surface temperature of Mars ranges from about −143 °C (−225 °F) during winters at the poles to
      ~35 °C (95 °F) during summer at the equator. On an average Mars is colder than our Antartican South Pole.</p>

    <h1> Planet Venus</h1>
    <p> Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet in the Solar System, and is sometimes called Earth's <em>sister planet</em> because of its similar size and mass. It is the second most brightest object in the sky, after Moon, and is also known as the
      Morning or Evening Star depending on where the planet is relative to Earth. </p>
    <p> Venus orbits around the Sun every 224 days, but unlike other inner planets it rotates in the counter-clockwise direction every 243 days â€” also known as <em> retrograde rotation. </em> One explanation is that Venus might have been hit by an asteroid
      in the past that caused the planet to rotate in opposite direction, but there is also a chance that Venus flipped over its poles due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_%28astronomy%29">perturbations </a> sometime during its orbital
      flight. </p>
    <p> Venus has a heavy and opaque atmosphere, laden with 92-95% CO<sub>2</sub> and a thick layer of clouds of sulfuric acid that absorb most of the radiant heat from Sun. But for the greenhouse effects of its atmosphere, Venus is the hottest planet in
      the Solar System. </p>
    <p> Like Earth, Venus too has an inner core, a solid mantle and a crust followed by an atmosphere. But it is a lifeless planet and is concluded to be geologically too harsh to sustain Earthlike life ever; despite the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming"> terraforming. </a>      </p>

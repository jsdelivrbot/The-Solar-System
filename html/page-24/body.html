    <p> Sun is also the source of life on our planet. Barring a few chemotrobes found at the bottom of the ocean, all known lifeforms depend on Sunlight. In fact if we look at it closely, Sun is at the bottom of the food chain. Our entire biosphere is derived
      from photosynthesis of Sun's radiation. </p>
    <p> In the words of Elon Musk, SpaceX:
      <p>
        <blockquote><em>What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already. If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin.</em> </blockquote>
        <p> The Sun is composed primarily of Hydrogen (74.9%) and Helium (23.8%) and a few other heavier elements (metals) like Oxygen, Carbon, Iron etc. This proportion changes over time as the Sun converts Hydrogen to Helium in its core through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"> Nuclear Fusion. </a>          </p>
        <p> Like Earth, Sun also rotates about its axis. Its sidereal rotation takes 25.05 days to complete at the equator and about 35 days at the poles. Why such a <em>differential rotation</em>? Because Sun is a molten ball of fire. The fluids near the
          poles move progressively slower than the fluids at the equator. </p>

    <p> we get the distance from Earth's center to the barycenter of the Earth-Moon system.</p>
    <p class="centerize"> \( D_{barycenter} \) = 2832.30 miles</p>
    <p> Since the radius of Earth is 3,959 miles, it means that the barycenter is located inside of Earth at about 1121 miles below its surface. Could anything weird happen in there at the level of barycenter? Well, it depends. Gravitational forces may loosen
      rocks a bit, push magmatic material up and that in turn could trigger an earthquake — but it is a conjecture not fully understood yet. </p>
    <p> Moon has a very thin atmosphere made up of mostly Argon, Helium and Hydrogen. This means that its surface is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds. It has a wide variation of temperature that goes from very hot at 107 °C during
      the day to very cold down to -153 °C at night. The lack of atmosphere also means that sound couldn't be heard on the Moon and the sky appears black even during the day. </p>
    <p> Here's a little quest for you: Find out why our sky is blue in color during the day? Search over the web or ask your Science mentor about it. </p>

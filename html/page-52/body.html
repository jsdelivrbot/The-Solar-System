    <p> Jupiter has a total of 67 Moons (as on 2014) orbiting it. The four largest moons of Jupiter are called the Galilean moons or Jovian satellites. They were first discovered by Galileo Galilei back in 1610 - an evidence in favor of the Copernican Heliocentric
      model. These moons are named Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa. The Ganymede, for a moon, is larger than the planet Mercury with a diameter of 3,273 miles. It is still called a moon because it is orbiting a planet and not directly the Sun. </p>
    <p> Jupiter takes 11.86 years to go around the Sun. On the other hand it takes only 9.93 hours to spin about its axis. A Jovian day is almost three times as fast as Earth! High speed of rotation and a gaseeous-fluid make up causes Jupiter to bulge at
      the equator into an oblate-spheroid shape. Jupiter also has a strong magnetic field (14 times as strong as on Earth), and it exhibits <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/61/5/003"> Aurorae </a>at its poles. </p>
    <p> Given that Jupiter is almost 300 times as massive as Earth it has a very strong gravity. Some astronomers believe that Jupiter helps protect us from long-orbit comets and stray objects entering into our Solar System. Jupiterâ€™s gravity slings them
      out before they can get close to Earth. However, Jupiter also nudges a few asteroids into the inner Solar System towards the Sun. And that increases a chance of a collision with Earth. </p>

    <p> As of 2014 Jupiter has a total of 67 Moons in orbit around it. The four largest ones are called the Galilean moons or the Jovian satellites. They were first discovered by Galileo Galilei back in 1610 - a solid evidence in favor of the Copernican Heliocentric
      model. These moons are named Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa. The Ganymede for a moon is larger than the planet Mercury with a diameter of 3,273 miles. It is still called a moon because it orbits a planet and not the Sun. Europa on the other hand
      carries liquid water, and therefore potentially life-bearing. </p>
    <p> Jupiter takes ~12 years to go around the Sun. But it takes only 9.93 hours to spin about its own axis. A Jovian day is one-third of a day on Earth! The high speed of rotation and its gaseous-fluid make up causes Jupiter to bulge at the equator
      into an oblate-spheroid shape. Jupiter also has a strong magnetic field (~14 times as strong as on Earth), and it exhibits <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/61/5/003"> Aurorae </a>at its poles. </p>
    <p> Given that Jupiter is ~300 times as massive as Earth is, its gravitational pull is very strong. Some scientists believe that Jupiter protects the inner solar system from long-orbit comets and stray objects. Jupiterâ€™s gravity slings them out or gobbles them up before those rocks
      can get close to us. However, Jupiter also nudges a few asteroids into the inner Solar System that increases the risk of a collision with Earth.

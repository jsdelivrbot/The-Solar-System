    <h1> Polarity Reversals </h1>
    <p> Earth's magnetic field has flipped polarity many times over in the past. Meaning Its magnetic north flipped over to the place where magnetic south currently is and vice-versa. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal">Geomagnetic Reversal</a>.
      Studies of artifacts and rocks on Earth show that polarity reversals have happened every few hundred thousand years and that the last flip occurred ~786,000 years ago. </p>
    <p> Scientists believe that the next geomagnetic reversal is long due and it should happen in the next few centuries. Data of the last hundred years indicates that Earth's magnetic field has been steadily decreasing and has weakened by over 5% already.
      While it is not unusual for the strength of Earth's magnetic field to fluctuate but during a polarity reversal it is expected to weaken by over 90% before reappearing strong on the other side of the planet again. </p>
    <p> As per NASA even when Earth's magnetic field would at its weakest there isn't a likelihood that it will disappear completely even momentarily. A weak magnetic shield might lead to slightly higher influx of solar radiation â€“ as well as a beautiful
      display of aurorae at lower latitudes - but nothing deadly is expected to happen. Besides there still would Earth's thick atmosphere to offer protection against the Solar and Cosmic radition. </p>

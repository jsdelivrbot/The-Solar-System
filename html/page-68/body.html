    <h1> Polarity Reversals </h1>
    <p> Since we recently looked at the <em> tennis racket theorem </em> for rotating bodies, it's a good time to learn about another kind of flip that happen on Earth. The Earth's magnetic field, powered by the rotating molten iron core at its center, also
      known as <a href="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~glatz/geodynamo.html">geodynamo</a>, has flipped polarity many a times over in the past. Meaning its magnetic north flipped over to the place where magnetic south currently is and vice-versa. This is also
      called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal">Geomagnetic Reversal</a>. </p>
    <p> Studies of artifacts and rocks on Earth show that polarity reversals have happened every few hundred thousand years and the last one occurred ~786,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the next geomagnetic reversal is long due and it should happen
      soon. Observations suggest that Earth's magnetic field has weakened by over 5% in the last one century. It is thought that during a polarity reversal Earth's magnetic field weakens by over 90% before reappearing on the other side strong again. </p>
    <p> According to NASA during a polarity reversal there isn't a likelihood that the magnetic field would disappear completely. A weakened shield might lead to slightly higher influx of solar particles â€“ and a beautiful display of aurorae - but nothing
      deadly is expected to happen. Besides there will still be Earth's atmosphere to offer protection against the Solar and Cosmic winds. </p>

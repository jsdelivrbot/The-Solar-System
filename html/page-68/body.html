    <h1> Polarity Reversal </h1>
    <p> Since we looked at the <em> tennis racket theorem </em> recently, it is a good time to learn about another kind of flip that happens on Earth: Polarity reversal. The Earth's magnetic field, powered by its rotating molten iron core known as <a href="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~glatz/geodynamo.html">geodynamo</a>,
      has flipped polarity many times in the past. This is also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal">Geomagnetic Reversal</a> which flips our North and South poles. </p>
    <p> Studies of artifacts and rocks on Earth show that polarity reversals have happened every few hundred thousand years and the last one occurred ~786,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the next geomagnetic reversal is long due and it should happen
      soon. Observations suggest that Earth's magnetic field has weakened by over 5% in the last one century. It is thought that during a polarity reversal Earth's magnetic field weakens by over 90% before reappearing on the other side again. </p>
    <p>
    According to NASA, during a polarity reversal there isn't a likelihood that the magnetic field would disappear completely. However, a weakened shield might lead to a slightly higher influx of solar radiation â€“ and a beautiful display of aurorae -
      but nothing deadly is expected to happen. There will still be Earth's atmosphere to offer protection against the Solar and Cosmic winds. </p>

    <p>Moon pitches better as an outpost, a space station where future travelers could take a refill before re-launching further out in to space. Broadly speaking, it depends on what we wish to achieve from these off-earth settlements. At this point when
      terraforming is still very much in theory and we barely have the means or tech to handle even our own environmental changes here on Earth, it is safe to assume that all ideas and dreams of interplanetary travel and resettlement are totally hypothetical.
      It would take at least few decades to realize what we can truly achieve outside of Earth.</p>

    <p> Secondly, there is always a chance to find an extra-solar planet that is similar to Earth. If that happens all the bets on terraforming projects will be affected and the chances of finding alien life, probably an intelligent one, would go through
      the roof. In other words, a celestial body that is very similar to Earth in chemistry and physics is likely going to be hosting life already.</p>
    <p> One such candidate within our Solar System is the Europa, a moon of planet Jupiter. Europa is enveloped in ice and sub-surface ocean of water that makes it similar to Earth. We'll look at it in the next chapter. </p>

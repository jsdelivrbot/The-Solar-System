    <p>Moon pitches home for an outpost instead: A space station where future travelers could take a refill before re-launching further out in to space. </p>
    <p> Broadly speaking a lot depends on our definition and scope of terraforming and what we want to achieve from these off-earth settlements. Today when terraforming is still in theory and we barely have the means to manage our own environmental changes
      here on Earth, it'd be safe to assume that interplanetary travel and colonization is still quite far away. A least few decades before we can understand what we can do outside of Earth.</p>
    <p> Secondly, there is always a chance to find an extra-solar equal of Earth. If that happens then focus will shift from terraforming dead hosts to better and faster travel instead. Or probably on finding alien life at the new host. For it is very likely
      that if a celestial body very similar to Earth is found then chances are that there will be diverse organic life on it already. Probably even intelligent.</p>
    <p> One interesting candidate within our Solar System that is similar to Earth is the Europa, the moon of planet Jupiter. Europa is small but enveloped in ice, oxygen and water that are known to be critical ingredients for life on Earth. Evidence so far
      dictates that Europa is potentially life-bearing already. But we'll look in to that in the next chapter. </p>

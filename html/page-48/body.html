    <p>Moon pitches better for an outpost, a space station where future travelers could take a refill before re-launching further out in to space. </p>
    <p> Broadly speaking, it depends on what we wish to achieve from these off-earth settlements. At this point when terraforming is still very much in theory and we barely have the means or tech to handle even our own environmental changes here on Earth,
      it is safe to assume that all ideas and dreams of interplanetary travel and resettlement are totally hypothetical. It would take at least few decades to realize what we can truly achieve outside of Earth.</p>

    <p> Secondly, there is always a chance to find an extra-solar planet that is similar to Earth. When that happens all bets on terraforming will be affected and the chances of finding alien life, probably an intelligent one, would go through the roof. In
      other words, if a celestial body is very similar to Earth in composition, chemistry and physics, chances are that it is host to diverse organic life already. </p>
    <p> One such interesting candidate within our Solar System is the Europa, the moon of planet Jupiter. Europa is enveloped in ice and a sub-surface ocean of liquid water. Space probes and data have indicated that Europa is potentially life-bearing. We'll
      take a close look at Europa in the next chapter. </p>

    <p>Moon pitches home for an outpost instead: A space station where future travelers could take a refill before re-launching further out in to space. </p>
    <p> Broadly speaking a lot depends on our definition and scope of terraforming and what we want to achieve from these off-earth settlements. Today when terraforming is still in theory and we barely have the means to manage our own environmental changes
      here on Earth, it'd be safe to assume that colonization is still far away. At least few decades before we can realize what can be achieved outside the Earth.</p>
    <p> Secondly, there is always a chance to find an extra-solar equal of Earth. If that happens, focus will shift from transforming dead hosts to better and faster travel. Or to find alien life at the new host. It is very likely that such a celestial body
      is already a host to diverse organic life. </p>
    <p> One interesting candidate within our Solar System that is similar to Earth is Europa, the moon of planet Jupiter. Europa is small but encrusted with minerals, water and Oxygen â€” all three ingredients necessary for life. Evidence suggests that Europa
      has microbial life already, but we'll take a closer look at it in the next chapter. </p>

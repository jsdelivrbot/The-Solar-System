    <p> <span class="first-word"> J</span>upiter is the largest and the most <em>influential</em> planet of our Solar System. It is called a gas giant because, well, it is made up of gases and fluids and doesn't seemingly have a rocky planetary surface. A
      few measurements indicate that Jupiter does have a solid core wrapped under a thick layer of metallic hydrogen but not enough data is available to establish a concrete picture yet. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29">Juno Orbiter</a>      is set to arrive on Jupiter in June next year (2016) to find answers to these questions. </p>
    <p> Jupiter is the fifth planet of our Solar System. At a distance of 483 million miles (comparatively Mars is only 142 million miles away) Jupiter receives very little light from the Sun. And it does so in no less than 43 minutes! That's the time it
      takes for light to travel half a billion miles. What's noteworthy here is that both Earth and Mars are closer to Sun than they are to Jupiter. There's a gap of almost 341 million miles between Mars and Jupiter - a zone that is also known as the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt">Asteroid Belt</a>. </p>
    <p> Jupiter has a very faint ring system. This ring is not visible to an unaided eye from Earth. The Jovian rings were discovered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager I </a> only in 1979 and are mainly made of dust particles, presumably
      collected from impacts, or rather rub-off of incoming comets and asteroids. The exact mechanism of how rings are formed is not understood yet. </p>

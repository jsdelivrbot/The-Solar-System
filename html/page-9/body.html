    <p class="first-para"> <span class="first-word"> It </span>took more than a thousand years and <em>courage</em> to figure out what our Solar System looks like, and how it works. Up until the sixteenth century only five planets were known to man. People believed that Earth
      was at the center of the Universe and Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn turned around it in succeeding celestial spheres. Strictly in that order. </p>
    <p> This was the Geocentric model, see visual overleaf, that ancient astronomer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (c. 87-150 AD) postulated almost 1500 years before Copernicus arrived. In 1543, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus </a>      (1473-1543) in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium">book</a> <em>De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium</em> published a new model with a stationary Sun at the center of the other planets — the heliocentric
      model. Copernicus also put planets in their correct order i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

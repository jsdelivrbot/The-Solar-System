    <p> Apart from sidereal rotation, the Sun along with the Solar System orbits around the Galactic Center (GC) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">Milky Way</a>. At a staggering velocity of 514,000 mph! It is estimated that a full revolution
      takes about 240 million terrestrial (Earth) years. Given that Sun is only ~4.57 billion years old it has been around the GC only 20 times so far. </p>
    <p> The time period to go around the galaxy is also called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year">Galactic Year</a>. Galactic Year(Gyr) is a convenient unit of time used to describe cosmic events in astronomy. For example, life on Earth
      began only 15 Gyrs ago, Big bang happened 61 Gyrs ago and so on. </p>

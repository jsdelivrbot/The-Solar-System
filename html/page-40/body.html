    <h1> Terraforming</h1>
    <p> Terraforming is a concept of applying engineering to transform a planet into an Earth-like host; especially, so that it can support human life. At present, terraforming is largely a realm of science fiction but the recent climate change of Earth
      suggests that human beings can potentially influence on a planetary scale. </p>
    <p> Most scientists agree that terraforming can bring dead worlds to life, but the methods suggested to implement it so far are either technically impossible or prohibitively expensive. Two important experiments to note are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon">colonization of Moon</a>      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Mars">colonization of Mars</a> programs. </p>
    <h1>The Doomsday Argument </h1>
    <p> The Doomsday argument (DA) is a probabilistic argument that, simply put, says that supposing the humans alive today are in a random place in the whole timeline of human history, chances are that we are about halfway through our survival history already.
      That there is a 95% chance of an extinction event within the next 9,120 years. </p>
    <p> Human colonization of other objects such as Mars, Moon or nearby planets thus makes for a better chance of survival for our species, should Earth face a cataclysmic event. </p>

    <h1> Formation & Evolution</h1>
    <p>Moon was formed roughly 30 to 50 million years after the birth of the Solar System. It is thought that a Mars sized object named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)">Theia</a> smashed into proto-Earth (early molten Earth) blasting
      off materials that later accreted to form the Moon. This is a theoretical explanation however, according to what the existing data and observation of the Earth-Moon system indicates. </p>
    <p> Here is a little story about Evolution of Moon by the <a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/">LRO</a> team at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center. </p>

    <p> So far we've covered three objects of our Solar System that are visible to our naked eye. And note, all three of them do not look like starry dots in the sky! </p>

    <p> Today we know that there are eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, the Sun, the Moon and a hundred and seventy two other planetary satellites (or moons) collectively orbiting the sun. We know that there are thousands of comets, asteriods, minor
      planets and other smaller objects that circle around the Sun in a state of <i> dynamic equilibrium. </i> </p>
    <p> Our understanding of space has gotten better and the tools that help us watch and observe space have improved considerably. We have a man-made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</a> (ISS)
      floating above the Earth to do science experiments in space. There is a giant <a href=""> Hubble telescope</a> to watch the sky just like Galileo did back in the day. Man has <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo11.html#.VMmgpYrF_xh">been on the moon</a>      (watch Apollo 11 montage overleaf) and countless probes have been delivered successfully to nearby planets and comet that continue to collect and send useful data to us. </p>
    <p> In other words, Astronomy continues to expand our horizon and yet our journey to space â€” to observe, discover and assimilate the knowledge of the Universe has only begun. This book aims to connect the dots and help us understand our Solar System better.

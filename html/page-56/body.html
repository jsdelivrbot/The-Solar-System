    <h1> The Inhospitality of Space </h1>
    <p>Space is inhospitable. But what is it like to be outside our atmosphere? How does the space in between planets feel? What would happen if we put ourselves in a rocket and flew out of Earth in just our
      tees and shorts? Here's a brief look at how one would fare in space, how bad it could be for someone who tries to spacewalk without a suit, even for a few moments. </p>
    <p> To begin with space is very cold. An isolated spot in the vacuum of space has an average temperature of 2.73° Kelvins (-455° Fahrenheit) only; i.e. barely above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a>. Technically speaking space
      doesn't even have a temperature of its own (it is a vacuum after all) but if an object is put in space without any source of heat nearby then the temperature of this object would fall down to the lowest possible temperature of 2.73°K eventually. That is cold enough for ice to be harder than steel.
    </p>
    <p> Since in our Solar System there is a heat source — the Sun — therefore the coldest temperature one could experience depends on the distance from the Sun. A metal bar just outside Earth's atmosphere, for example, heats up to 500°F on the side facing
      the Sun and cools down to -150°F on the side in shadow. That'd feel quite painful with a boiling sensation on one side and freezing cold on the other. A spacesuit balances this temperature gradient for an astronaut. </p>

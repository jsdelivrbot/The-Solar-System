    <p>For long we've talked about planets, their moons and the Sun but we rarely touched the space that is in between. What happens when we step just outside of our atmsophere? Does space freeze us to death or evaporates us into the vacuum? Let us look
      at what it is going to be like in space in our shorts, tees and crocs. </p>

    <p> To begin with our entire Universe is very cold. At an average of 2.73 Kelvins (minus 455Â°F), the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, a leftover of the big bang. As you can see it is barely above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a>.
      At the point where Helium becomes a superfluid. Technically speaking space doesn't have a temperature of its own. Physical objects when placed in space receive heat from other sources, like the Sun, through radiation or via cosmic background. </p>

    <p>Many years ago a group of scientist, who were trying to figure out why radios had static (noise), discovered that they had accidentally measured the average temperature of the universe. It turned out to be </p>

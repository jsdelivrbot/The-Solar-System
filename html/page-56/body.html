    <h1> The Inhospitality of Space </h1>
    <p>Now that we've talked about several planets, their moons and the Sun let's take a look at the space in between. What is it like to be outside of our atmosphere? How does the space feel? Does it freeze or heat one up in the vacuum? Here's a quick look
      at how bad space could be to somebody if exposed to it accidently. </p>
    <p> To begin with, space is very cold. An isolated spot in it typically has an average temperature of 2.73° Kelvins (-455° Fahrenheit) only; i.e. barely above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a>. Technically speaking
      space doesn't have a temperature of its own, for it's a vacuum after all, but if an object is put in space without any source of heat nearby then its temperature would eventually fall to the lowest minimum of 2.73°K only. That is so cold that even
      ice is harder than steel at those temperatures. </p>
    <p> Since in our Solar System there is a heat soure — the Sun — therefore the lowest possible temperature would depend on the distance from Sun. Typically, a metal bar just outside Earth's atmosphere would heat up to 500°F on the side facing the Sun and
      cool down to about -150°F on the side opposite to it. That'd feel like boiling hot on one side and deathly cold on the other. A spacesuit uses this temperature gradient to balance the heat for the astronauts. </p>

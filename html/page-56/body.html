    <h1> The Inhospitality of Space </h1>
    <p> What is so inhospitable about space? How does it feel outside of our atmosphere? What would happen if we jumped into a rocket and flew out of Earth in just our tees and shorts? Here's a quick look at how one would fare in space, and how bad it could
      get if we were to spacewalk without a spacesuit. Even for a minute! </p>
    <p> To begin with, space is very cold. An isolated spot in the vacuum of space has an average temperature of 2.73° Kelvins (-455° Fahrenheit) only; i.e. barely above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a>. Technically
      speaking, space doesn't even have a temperature of its own (it is a vacuum after all). If an object is placed in space without any source of heat nearby then the temperature of this object would eventually fall to the lowest possible temperature
      of 2.73°K. That is cold enough for ice to be harder than steel. </p>
    <p> Since in our Solar System there is a heat source — the Sun — the coldest one could experience would depend on one's distance from the Sun. For example, a metal bar just outside the Earth's atmosphere heats up to 500°F on the side facing the Sun and
      cools down to -150°F on the side that is in shadow. That'd feel quite painful with a boiling hot sensation on one side and freezing cold on the other. A spacesuit balances this temperature gradient for an astronaut. </p>

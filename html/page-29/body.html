    <p> <span class="first-word">M</span>oon is our nearest neighbor in space. We've been to it five times! At a distance of 238,857 miles from Earth, it usually takes three days for our spaceships (or rockets) to travel and land on the Moon. That's an average
      spaceship velocity of 3,318 mph. However, this isn't the fastest our spaceships could go. Last, the quickest trip was with the New Horizons probe when it zipped past the Moon in just under 8 hours 35 minutes, clocking an average velocity of ~28,101
      mph! </p>
    <p>The Moon is our only natural satellite. Some other planets — like Jupiter — have more than one natural satellite but we'll come to those later. Moon takes 27.32 days to go one full round around the Earth. It also rotates about its own axis in roughly
      the same time viz. 27.32 days. This is called <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/Synchronous_Rotation.pdf">synchronous rotation</a>, a phenomena that explains why we see only one side - the near side - of the Moon (See a visual explanation
      overleaf). </p>
    <p> Synchronous rotation is caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal locking</a> of Moon to Earth. This locking has a great influence on life on Earth. For example, it causes oceanic buldging, causes low and high tides, stabilizes
      Earth's rotational axis and even decelerates Earth's rotation due to <em>tidal braking</em>. There is a school of thought that believes that complex life on Earth wouldn't have been possible without the Moon. </p>

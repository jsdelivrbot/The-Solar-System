    <p> Nor land to cultivate on. Moon is cold, arid and a vacuum all over. Mars on the other hand has an atmosphere. But that is poisonous with mostly Carbon Dioxide. And Mars is even colder than Moon. It recieves only 40% as much Sun light as we do here
      on Earth. Settling anywhere outside of Earth, therefore, isn't going to be easy. It is rather <em>nearly impossible</em>. Almost begs the question that if it were possible at all wouldn't life then would have taken up that opportunity (in some
      form) already? </p>
    <h3> Terraform </h3>
    <blockquote>— to artificially transform the natural characteristics of a celestial body, or a portion of it, within a limited time-frame, so as to make it possible for independent Earth-like life to sustain indefintely. </blockquote>
    
    
    <p>Theoretically speaking terraforming depends on many factors. Like the scale of change warranted and its cost, availabilty of suitable technology to bring about that change, ability to travel the distance with such a catalyzing technology, ability
      to handle the complexity and challenges of the existing environment etc.</p>
    
    <p> Most scientists agree that setting up an enclosure on Moon is easier and cheaper than setting up a shop on Mars. Yet Mars might fare better when it comes to terraforming because of its ability to hold an atmosphere.
      Moon? — not so much. </p>

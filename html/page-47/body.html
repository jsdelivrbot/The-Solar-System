    <p> Nor any land to cultivate. Moon is cold, arid and vacuum all over. Mars on the other hand has an atmosphere. But it is poisonous, with mostly Carbon Dioxide. Mars is even colder than Moon, receiving only 40% as much sunlight as we do here on Earth.
      Settling anywhere outside of Earth, therefore, is not going to be easy. It begs the question that if it were at all possible, wouldn't life have taken up that opportunity (in some form) already? </p>
    <h3> Terraform </h3>
    <blockquote>â€” to artificially transform the natural characteristics of a celestial body, or a portion of it, within a limited time-frame, so as to make it possible for independent Earth-like life to sustain indefintely. </blockquote>
    <p>Theoretically speaking terraforming depends on many factors. Such as the scale of change warranted and its cost, availabilty of suitable technology to bring about that change, ability to travel the distance with such a catalyzing technology, ability
      to handle the complexity and challenges of the existing environment etc.</p>
    <p> Most scientists agree that setting up an enclosure on Moon is easier and cheaper than setting up a shop on Mars. Yet Mars might fare better when it comes to idea of terraforming because of its ability to hold an atmosphere. </p>

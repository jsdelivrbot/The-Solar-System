    <p> Mars on the other hand is even colder. It is enveloped completely in a poisonous gas, Carbon Dioxide, and recieves only 40% as much Sun light as we do on Earth. Settling anywhere outside of Earth therefore, isn't going to be easy nor straightforward.
      It almost begs the question that if it were easy or even possible wouldn't there have been evolved life discovered there any way? </p>
    <p>Terraforming depends on many factors. Like the scale of change warranted and its cost, availabilty of suitable technology to leverage that change, ability to travel the distance with such a catalyzing technology, ability to handle the complexity and
      unforeseen challenges of such manned or unmanned missions. And most importantly it depends on the <em>definition </em>of terraforming itself.</p>
    <blockquote> To artificially transform the natural characteristics of a celestial body, or a portion of it, within a limited time-frame, so as to make it indefintely sustainable for an independent Earth-like life. </blockquote>
    <p> Most agree that setting up an enclosure on Moon is technically easier (and cheaper) than setting up a shop on Mars. Yet Mars fares better when it comes to the idea of terraforming. Its stronger gravitational field and thus the ability to hold an atmosphere
      makes it possible be terraformed. Moon? Perhaps no. Moon could mostly pitch for an outpost only. A large space station where future travelers could take a refill before re-launching further out in to space. </p>

    <p> <span class="first-word"> M</span>ars is the fourth and the <em>last</em> terrestial planet of our Solar System. What follows beyond Mars are the gas and ice giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - i.e. planets that do not have a solid rocky
      surface. Given that Mercury and Venus are inhospitable, and we couldn't possibly land on gas giants ever, Mars easily becomes a candidate of great interest to see if it can be terraformed. </p>
    <p> Mars is called the red planet because of its reddish-orange tinge off its iron ( Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%28III%29_oxide">Iron Oxide / Hematite</a> ) rich soil. It has a thin atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide
      (96%), Argon (1.93%) and Nitrogen (1.89%, along with some traces of Oxygen and moisture. The surface of Mars is like that of our Moon: Scarred with thousands of impact craters. It is also exposed to cosmic and solar radiation in absence of enough
      atmospheric resistance or a decent magnetosphere. </p>
    <p> Mars is roughly half the diameter of Earth but only a tenth its mass. Gravity on Mars is thus significantly lower, about 38% of that on Earth. It also receives much lesser sunlight (about 43% less) than we do on our planet. So far no sign of life,
      not even microbial, has been found on Mars. Though, a few plumes of locally ejected methane from below the surface of Mars were detected. </p>
